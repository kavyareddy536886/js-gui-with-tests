> JavaScript and Bootstrap Material Design are perfect for building apps with user interaction - and easy testing with qUnit

## Links

- [Demo](https://profcase.github.io/js-gui-with-tests/)
- [Source](https://github.com/profcase/js-gui-with-tests)

## Requirements

- A browser (e.g., Firefox or Chrome)
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code or Notepad++, or Chrome)
- Web Server for Chrome Extension (or view the [Demo](https://profcase.github.io/js-gui-with-tests/))

## IMPORTANT! Serve the tests so we can use fetch

This example uses the fetch API to grab all the HTML from the app for testing.

We can't serve as a local file when we use fetch, so to run the tests locally, use:

- [Web Server for Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)

## API

- [Internet Chuck Norris Database API](http://www.icndb.com/)

## Benefits

- No build tools required
- qUnit uses simple HTML and JavaScript
